There are 4 different tree representations used in this project: horizontal tree
, radial tree, layered tree, and tree map. Horizontal or vertical tree is the
most direct and traditional tree data representation. It clearly shows the
connection between the parent nodes and children nodes with leveled positions.
However, when there are many layers in the tree with only a few nodes attached,
this way of presenting makes it hard for the audience to trace back the parent
nodes in the upper levels, and also stretches the graph. Radio tree makes the
whole graph clear in one circle and it's easy to directly look at all nodes in one
glance. But it's harder to trace the parent of the node since all links are
twisted in some way to fit into the figure. Layered tree representation clearly
shows the proportion or value of each node, but makes it harder to see the when
there are many children nodes belong to one parent. At last, tree map shows
proportion of the nodes in a direct way, but makes the children nodes relatively
small when there are a lot of them.

From my perspective, the traditional horizontal or vertical tree representation
is the best way of presenting the relationships in the data. The collapse
interaction makes it easy to understand the files at each layer without being
distrubed by crowded links and nodes. It's also easy to find the flow of nodes
this way, which, I believe, is an important aspect of the data representation when
trying to visualize it into a tree.
