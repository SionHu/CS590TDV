* Task 1:
    Compare the results that you obtained in each case.
    What are the pros and cons of the layout you obtained with and without using
    the provided coordinates?
    Which one do you find superior and why?
- Answer:
    Without using the provided coordinates, the nodes of the force graph is more
    towards the gravity center. It's easier to have a close look at the entire
    graph, but it's certainly not useful to see the clear relationships between
    the nodes, since many of them are clustering with each other. Although, dragging
    makes it more fun to play with, moving links disturb the focus of the audience
    in a certain level.

    The graph with coordinates, on the other hand, requires a relatively larger scale
    to present due to the various distances between nodes' coordinates. However, it shows
    more geometric information of the nodes (airports) on the graph, and demonstrates
    more clear relationships between the nodes.

    I will choose the nodes with coordinates.
